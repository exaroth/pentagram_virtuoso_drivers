Hanvon tablet driver
====================

Driver for Linux kernels which supports complete functionality of the tablet:
pen coordinates, touch/float/click detection, pressure, x and y tilt, pen
button. On Artmaster I four simple tablet buttons (note that the first
one works only together with pen activity), and the slider button.


Supported hardware
==================

Artmaster I: AM0806, AM1107, AM1209
Rollick: RL0604, RK0504
添加了 RK0504 的支持。原驅動在 Debian 7.6(Linux 3.2.0-amd64) 下無法運作。


Installation
============

Type 'make' to compile the module. New file hanvon.ko will be produced in
current directory. Load the module with root permissions

insmod ./hanvon.ko

If everything goes right the tablet should start working immediately.


Diagnostics
===========

After insmod, check with dmesg, if the module was loaded properly.  
"USB Hanvon tablet driver" should appear in the listing.

lsmod should also contain hanvon in its listing: lsmod | grep hanvon
